# FlipScript
A web tool that creates a series of swipable pages/panes from a [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/) file.

The idea is that it makes a long demo script easier to follow, but there are plenty of applications for any document that is written in Markdown that needs to be split based on headers.

Written in C# ASP.NET Core 1.0 RC1 MVC

You can see the site itself at [FlipScript.AzureWebsites.Net](http://FlipScript.AzureWebsites.net) which is deployed automatically based on the most recent commit to this repo
